<p><b>Instructions</b>: Using the v_art, magazine, and employee schemas,
write SQL queries in Workbench that solve each of the following
scenarios or questions. Write all your queries in one tab in Workbench.
Please number your queries by writing a comment above each of your
queries similar to this comment:</p>

<code>-- Query 1</code>

<p>Save your SQL script with all seven queries as a .sql file and submit
your saved .sql file.</p>

<h3>v_art Schema</h3>
<p>1. When you visit
<a href="http://art.byuiwebdev.com/">art.byuiwebdev.com</a> and you
search by Period/Style and you choose Impressionism, you get two
resulting images ("Woman in the Garden" and "Irises"). What query could
be used in the website code that allows the user to see these images? No
join is needed.</p>

<p>2. When you visit
<a href="https://art.byuiwebdev.com/">art.byuiwebdev.com</a> and you
search by Subject and type in the word flower, you get three images.
What query would have allowed the user to get those results? (Remember
the keyword might have been 'flowers' but the user typed 'flower'.)</p>
