        <h1>Functions</h1>
        
        <p>In MySQL, a function is a stored program that returns a value or manipulated text. This allows us to perform manipulations on the data before retrieving or saving it. Functions have a name that you refer to and can also accept one or more parameters that can be passed into the function. </p>
        <h3 class="syntax"><function name>(parameter1, parameter2, ...)</h3>
        <p>
           In this lesson, we will be looking at scalar functions that operate on the individual rows of a table.  Scalar means the function will work on a single entity of data, not a group of data together. So if the function is used with a table with many rows the function will work on each single value or entity of data in each row.
        
        <h2>Types of Functions:</h2>
        
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Text</td>
            <td>used to manipulate strings of text</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Numeric</td>
            <td>used to perform mathematical operations on numeric data</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Date & Time</td>
            <td>used to manipulate data and time values and to extract specific components</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>System</td>
            <td>returns information specific to the DBMS being used</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
        
        <p>
            We will be going over some of the more common text, numeric, and date & time functions.

        <p>
            Let’s use the key table to demonstrate some of the functions.
        </p>
        <pre>
 SELECT * FROM key
         </pre>
        
        <img class='narrowimg' src="images/artist_definitions.png" alt="image of the artist table column definitions in Workbench">
        <p>
            Here we have a few columns have a null value as the default if nothing is entered for that column value. We also have a local column with the default value of ‘n’. That column tells us whether the artist is local or not. Most artists are not local, so the value of ‘n’ will be inserted into that column if no other value is placed there as data is entered for that row. Also notice that the artist_id is set up as auto-increment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We can insert data into this table in a few different ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can use the keyword of DEFAULT instead of an actual integer for any auto-incremented field. And we can also use NULL to leave a data value null. Or DEFAULT to enter the default value amount.
        </p>
        <pre>

 INSERT INTO artist VALUES
 (DEFAULT, 'Vincent', NULL, 'van Gogh', '1853', NULL, 'France', DEFAULT);
            </pre>
        <p>
            Since we already defined NULL in our column definitions for mname and dod, we could have also used DEFAULT for mname and dod instead of NULL.
        </p>
        <p>
            Or this INSERT would do the same thing.
        </p>

        <pre>

 INSERT INTO artist 
    (fname, lname, dob, country)
 VALUES
    ('Vincent', 'van Gogh', '1853', 'France');
            </pre>
        <p>
            Because we have an auto-increment for artist_id it will be filled in automatically and mname, dod, and local will all just get the default values filled in automatically from the column definitions.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            You can also enter data into your tables in the table view in Workbench without using the SQL INSERT command. When you apply the data you’ve entered, it will create an INSERT statement for you to run. When entering a string or string literal this way, you don’t have to put quotes around the string value.
        </p>

        <h1>UPDATE Statement</h1>
        <h3>The UPDATE Statment Syntax:</h3>
        <h3 class="syntax">UPDATE table_name <br>SET column_name = expresson <br>WHERE search_condition</h3>
        <p>
            To modify or edit your data that is already entered into a table you can use the UPDATE statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we wanted to change Vincent’s first name to Vinny we would use this UPDATE statement.
        </p>
        <pre>

 UPDATE artist 
 SET fname = 'Vinny' 
 WHERE artist_id = 2;

            </pre>

        <h1>DELETE Statement</h1>
        <h3>The DELETE Statment Syntax:</h3>
        <h3 class="syntax">DELETE FROM table_name <br>WHERE search_condition</h3>
        <p>
            To delete a row of a table we can use a DELETE statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we wanted to delete the van Gogh row from our table we would use this DELETE statement.
        </p>
        <pre>

 DELETE FROM artist  
 WHERE lname = 'van Gogh';

            </pre>

        <p>
            Don’t forget to always use a WHERE clause with UPDATE and DELETE otherwise every row in the table will be UPDATED or DELETED. You might need to turn off the Safe Mode in Workbench by going to ‘Preferences’ – ‘SQL Editor’ and uncheck “Safe Updates’ near the bottom of the preferences there. Remember there is no undo button once you run a UPDATE or DELETE statement. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The way we create our database this week, we will not need to use the CREATE command because Workbench does that for us in the forward engineering from our ERD to the database set up. We also should not need to use DROP to delete any of our tables or any of our databases. If we need to delete a table or database from Workbench because we made a mistake or want to start over you can run a DROP statement but be careful not to drop something you don’t mean to. You can also right click the table or database name from your schema list in Workbench and drop them that way.  Be very careful with the DROP command. There is no undo button.
        </p>

        <h1>Referential Integrity and Foreign Key Constraints</h1>
        <p>
            Referential Integrity implies that relationships among data should be enforced. This will guarantee that relationships between rows in two tables will remain synchronized during all updates and deletes. When we create a database from our ERD diagram the foreign keys are by default mandatory (or they are already enforcing the relationships between tables. This is referred to as Foreign Key Constraints. This constraint enforces the referential integrity by guaranteeing that changes cannot be made to data in the primary key table if those changes invalidate the link to data in the foreign key table. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is important to know because, as we enter data, edit and delete data in our tables, we cannot delete a row of data that has a foreign key associated with the primary key of that row in another table. We also cannot add a row to a table with a foreign key that does not already exist as a primary key of another table. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So if an attempt is made to delete a row in a primary key table or to change a primary key value, the action will fail when the deleted or changed primary key value corresponds to a value in the foreign key of another table. To edit or delete a row in a foreign key, you must first either delete the foreign key data in the foreign key table or change the foreign key data in the foreign key table, which links the foreign key to the different primary key.
