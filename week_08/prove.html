<p><b>Purpose</b>: In addition to using functions properly, the purpose
of this assignment is for you to practice problem solving; analyzing
what a question asks and breaking the problem into steps that lead to a
solution.</p>

<p><b>Instructions</b>: Using the magazine and bike schemas, write SQL
queries in Workbench that solve each of the following scenarios or
questions. Write all your queries in one tab in Workbench. Please number
your queries by writing a comment above each of your queries similar to
this comment:</p>

<code>-- Query 1</code>

<p>Save your SQL script with all five queries as a .sql file and submit
your saved .sql file.</p>

<h3>Magazine Schema</h3>

<h3>Bike Schema</h3>
<p>4. We need a list of all the product names without the year at the
end of the product_name string. Notice that some product_names have two
years listed. Make sure you take those off as well. Order your results
by product_id and limit your results to the first 14.</p>

<p>5. List the product name and then take the 2024 model year bikes and
divide the price into 3 equal payments. Display one of the payments with
a dollar sign, comma at the thousands place, and two decimal places.</p>
