        <h1>Database Design</h1>

        <h2>What is the purpose of good design?</h2>

        <p>With database design we are trying to organize the data in such a way that redundancy is minimized without losing any data. Redundancy is when we repeat the same data more than once. For example, each time a student registers for a class their name and address might be repeated for each class in which they are registered. Another way you might have repeating data is if you have a list of those same students and their addresses in a separate file listing parking passes or ticket violations. Say the student’s address changes, then changing the address would mean editing in different locations; not only in multiple places in registration, but also in a different file at the parking office. There is a greater chance of making a data entry mistake when you must edit in multiple places. It takes more time and resources as well. Having multiple copies of information also increases the chances for unauthorized access to data that should be secure. </p>

        <p>So for relational database design, reducing redundancy means splitting the data up into separate entities or tables to minimize redundancy. But it is not always clear how to do this, especially with large ‘real-life’ databases. Database design can be complex. You may not be the person who will design the database, usually this is the database administrator, but knowing the proper way to design a database will help you understand the structure of the database you work with.</p>

        <h2>The Statement of Work</h2>

        <p>It is wise to start with determining what output is needed and work backwards from there to determine what data is even going to be used in the database. You will take a look at those who will use the database system and what output they need from the system to do their jobs well. These users may not know anything about database design, but they do know exactly what they need to do their job. As you analyze the needs of the business you can determine what is needed for the database. This may require a lengthy time period to accomplish. 
        </p>

        <p>A starting point would be to create something like a ‘Statement of Work” which is a document that describes the work that needs to be done on a project. It can help clarify the project for both the users and the database designer. 
        </p>

        <p>There are a number of different elements that can go into creating a Statement of Work. We will cover 4 basic elements of the statement of work. 
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><h3>History</h3></li>
            <p>Here is where you will find out why they need the database system in the first place. What is the current system like or perhaps they may not even have a current digital system and they need one. How did they come up with their current system? What problems is that current system causing? What are its limitations? At this points it helpful to realize you need to be prepared with helpful questions you can ask to get the users to focus on the important aspects they need. Make sure to do a lot of listening so you can understand exactly what is needed. Keep your preconceived notions of what you think out of the discussion.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Scope</h3></li>
            <p>Basically scope is a description of what needs to be done. It is a general statement of the requirements and expectations of the project. It does not go into detailed about how exactly this will be done but the overall description. This may also include general constraints such as time and budget constraints. What software and hardware will be needed and who will do the work?
            </p>
            <li><h3>Purpose</h3></li>
            <p>The objective element of the statement of work involves the purpose of the project; what it is intended to achieve? This does not include specifics about each of the elements of the database, but what the database is supposed to achieve. What outputs will be produced by the system? Remember, users know what they need to do a good job. You will listen to them, look at their current outputs, screen views, reports, forms etc. and get an idea of what information your database will need to produce. 
            </p>
            <li><h3>Timeline</h3></li>
            <p>So the statement of work can be the beginning point to see what will be going into the database design. We will not get into too many details of this process for this introductory course; many of the databases we use with come with assumptions that we have already been through this process. However, it is not something you want to skip in a real world situation. It is a mistake to think you know how to begin the design process before you have studied it out thoroughly with those who will be using the system.
            </p>
        </ol>


        <h2>Basic Steps for Proper Design</h2>

        <p>Relational databases model real-world environments. The designer must analyze the real-world system and design it into a relational database.</p>

        <p>Let’s look at an example of designing for a system that uses books and their associated information as output. Here’s a flat file showing all the data that is needed for the system:</p>

        <p>Each book is listed with the title, author, and publisher. For relational databases, one table in the database will represent one entity in the real world with each row being one instance of that entity and one column storing an attribute associated with that entity.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><h3>Step 1 - Each table should be only one real-world entity.</h3></li>
            <p>Right now we have 3 different entities all in one table. We have books, authors and publishers. We can see that not only are authors repeating, but so are publishers. Remember we want to eliminate redundancy. </p>

            <p>The first two columns go with the real world entity of books. The next two columns go with the entity of author and the last two columns go with the entity of publisher. Now we can eliminate the redundancy and have Sue Smith only listed once and Acme Publishing only listed once.</p>

            <p>Differentiating between entities and attributes within those entities, can be tricky sometimes. For example maybe we find that we want to keep track of the author’s home address and their work address. Then all of the sudden those attributes of the author’s table would become a separate table called Author Address with a foreign key that relates to the author’s primary key. You will ultimately make these decisions based on what output is needed from the database. For now we will leave the entities as they are. </p>

            <li><h3>Step 2 - Identify primary and foreign keys.</h3></li>

            <p>The book entity already has a great natural key that uniquely identifies each book; the ISBN number. But there is a possibility of two different authors having the same name or even publishing companies having the same name, so we need a unique primary key for each of those tables. Here they have been assigned surrogate keys for the primary keys. Surrogate key are keys that the system is automatically assigning to each row to make them unique. </p>

        <p>Let’s look at the relationships of the entities now, which will help us establish the foreign keys. The relationship between Publishers and Books is a one to many. A book belongs to one publisher and a publisher can publish many books. The foreign key will be located in the table with the many part of the relationship. So the primary key of Publisher becomes the foreign key of Books. See how Acme Publishing, 001 is listed multiple times as the foreign key. They are the publisher for two different books, “Intro to Databases” and “Date Types”.</p>

            <p>The Books and Authors tables have a many-to-many relationship; books can have many authors and authors can write many books. Therefore, there will be a linking table between the two to resolve the many-to-many into 2 one-to-many relationships. The linking table will have the foreign keys made up of each primary key of the other tables. So in our linking table we have a composite key, meaning two attributes together make sure each row is unique. Together these two foreign keys make up the primary key of the linking table. We have author ID 22 repeated a few times and ISBN 4-4444-4444-4 repeated a few times but when we put each key together with the other key they uniquely identify each row. No two rows have both those attributes together exactly the same. We can see the many-to- many being resolved here. Sue is the author of multiple books and the book ‘Data Types’ has two authors. And it is all designed properly now for a relational database.
