<h2>Week 03 Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Learn the purpose of a database</li>
<li>Describe the different types of databases</li>
<li>Learn the different architectures and hardware of a database system</li>
<li>Learn about data storage and the different types of data (data types)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="beforeTheWeekBegins">
<h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will go over preparation materials and complete the preparation check before class on Monday.</li>
<li>If you choose, you can create an ERD for their data and, as you get their spreadsheets, you can take all their data and place it into a database. You can use this ERD as an example to show in class. ERDs and datatypes are introduced this week. This takes a little time to enter all their data, but it's fun for them to see their own data used in a relational database. I usually just put all their data into one workbook and include primary and foreign keys there. Then I import the spreadsheets as .csv files in Workbench.</li>

<li>Consider reviewing the teaching tips and suggestions in the CIT111 - W03 Course Group discussion <a href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-returntype="Discussion">https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734</a>.</li>

<h2>During the Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>First of the week:
<ul>
<li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of the week and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (W03 - Big Data)</p>

<li><a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAZ8lK224Kw" data-preview-alt="THE HUMAN FACE OF BIG DATA | Trailer | PBS">THE HUMAN FACE OF BIG DATA | Trailer | PBS</a></li>
<li>Discuss how data is helping to build the kingdom (gather Israel) with Geneology data. President Nelson has said that "the gathering is &ldquo;<em>the greatest</em>&nbsp;challenge,&nbsp;<em>the greatest</em>&nbsp;cause, and&nbsp;<em>the greatest</em> work on earth today". Databases play a huge role in this process.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Have groups discuss ways 'Big Data' companies might use data to personalize your experience with them. Adding personalization takes a lot of storage.&nbsp; What data might they need to store about each user? Give each group a company to discuss and then share: Amazon, Facebook, Expedia, Google, etc.</li>
<li>Remind students of the quiz the second class of the week, there will be a quiz the second day of each week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mid-week
<ul>
<li>The quiz this week will be on datatypes and database models.</li>
<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(W03 - ERD and Datatypes Intro):</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Show the students how you are entering the data they had in their spreadsheet as tables in the database by looking at the ERD you will use. Look at the datatypes you chose and why. Look at the datatype drop down for other types of data and discuss what you might store in some of the other datatypes. Point out how the way the table columns are used in the ERD will reduce data redundancy. They will be learning about the relationships next week. You can leave the relationship crows feet off if you would like or let them know it will be explained next week. This week we just want to show the column attribute arrangements and datatypes used in the ERD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>This is just to give them a sneak peak of the ERD, but not actually teaching how to create the ERD. They will take a look at the table design and table data next week with the same data.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>End of the Week
