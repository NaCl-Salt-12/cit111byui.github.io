<h2>Week 09 Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create multiple tables queries</li>
<li>Code queries with inner joins</li>

<h2>During the Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>First of the week:

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate, explain and have them follow along with different queries using joins. Here are some examples you could use:</li>
<pre>
USE v_art;

-- A list of all the artists with each of their art works

SELECT fname, lname, title
FROM artist JOIN artwork
	ON artist.artist_id = artwork.artist_id;

-- A list of all the artists even if they don't have any artwork
-- in other words: all artist and only related artwork

SELECT fname, lname, title
FROM artist LEFT JOIN artwork
	ON artist.artist_id = artwork.artist_id;

-- Show them art.ceiwebdev.com

-- What is I only want Leonardo diVinci's

SELECT fname, lname, title, artfile, period, arttype, artlocation
FROM artist JOIN artwork
	ON artist.artist_id = artwork.artist_id
WHERE lname = 'da Vinci';

-- On their own: A list of all the artwork from artist in the 
-- Netherlands

SELECT title, artfile, period, arttype, artlocation
FROM artwork JOIN artist
	ON artist.artist_id = artwork.artist_id
WHERE country = "Netherlands";



USE bike;

SELECT * FROM category;

SELECT * FROM product;

SELECT product_name, category_name, list_price
FROM product JOIN category
	ON product.category_id = category.category_id;
    
-- I also want the brand as well, this involves 3 tables
SELECT product_name, category_name, brand_name, list_price
FROM product JOIN category
	ON product.category_id = category.category_id
    JOIN brand
    ON product.brand_id = brand.brand_id;
    
-- On their own: All children category bikes

SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM product JOIN category
	ON product.category_id = category.category_id
WHERE category_name = "Children Bicycles";

SELECT * FROM store;
SELECT * FROM staff;

-- On their own: All staff at Rowlett Bikes Store

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM staff JOIN store
	ON staff.store_id = store.store_id
WHERE store_name = "Rowlett Bikes";

-- All products ordered with price and quantity, shows need for grouping later

SELECT product_name, cust_order_id, product.list_price, quantity
FROM product JOIN cust_order_item
	ON product.product_id = cust_order_item.product_id
ORDER BY cust_order_id;

SELECT * FROM cust_order;

-- All products ordered in March 2016

SELECT product_name, cust_order.cust_order_id, product.list_price, quantity, order_date

    ON cust_order.cust_order_id = cust_order_item.cust_order_id
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2016-03-01' AND '2016-03-31';

-- More joins (table aliases, more practice with outer joins)

-- show table aliases, AS is an optional keyword with column aliases
-- and with table aliases

SELECT subscriberLastName AS lastname, subscriberFirstName, subscriptionStartDate
FROM subscriber sr
	JOIN subscription sn -- add LEFT OUTER later to review OUTER JOINS Walter shows
		ON sr.subscriberKey = sn.subscriberKey
ORDER BY lastname;

-- reverse the two table's order and show how it's the same with RIGHT

-- There is one magazine with no subscribers. How would you show all magazines
-- and only the related data of the subscription table? (On their own)
-- list out magazineName, magazinePrice, and subscriptionStartDate (use table aliases)

SELECT magazineName, magazinePrice, subscriptionStartDate
FROM magazine m LEFT JOIN subscription s
	ON m.magazineKey = s.magazineKey;
    
-- Now add to the query above the 3rd table of subscribers so you can see
-- their last name (demonstrates using 3 tables in a OUTER JOIN) (On their Own)
-- It should still show the one magazine with  date and name as null

SELECT magazineName, magazinePrice, subscriptionStartDate, subscriberLastName
FROM magazine m 
	LEFT JOIN subscription s
	ON m.magazineKey = s.magazineKey
    LEFT JOIN subscriber sr
    ON s.subscriberKey = sr.subscriberKey;
    
-- need the second JOIN as LEFT otherwise you don't get all the results from 
-- the first join that includes the one magazine with no relations
-- draw a Venn diagram to explain with 3 circles. 

-- Demonstrate a FULL OUTER JOIN simulated with UNION in MySQL
-- Copy the LEFT OUTER JOIN above and UNION it to Same with ithe RIGHT JOINS

SELECT magazineName, magazinePrice, subscriptionStartDate, subscriberLastName
FROM magazine m 
	LEFT JOIN subscription s
	ON m.magazineKey = s.magazineKey
    LEFT JOIN subscriber sr
    ON s.subscriberKey = sr.subscriberKey
UNION
SELECT magazineName, magazinePrice, subscriptionStartDate, subscriberLastName
FROM magazine m 
	RIGHT JOIN subscription s
	ON m.magazineKey = s.magazineKey
    RIGHT JOIN subscriber sr
    ON s.subscriberKey = sr.subscriberKey;
    
-- show Venn diagrams with two 3 part tables coming together and shading everything.

<li>Remind students of the quiz the second class of the week.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mid-week
<ul>
<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
