<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Because not all student created the art database properly, have the import the v_art database from the dump file so they all have the same database to query from</li>
<li>They will also use a new bike shop database this week. Have the also import that database as well.</li>
<li>Demonstrate, explain, and have them follow along with examples of querying the v_art and bike databases. Here are some examples:</li>
<pre>
USE v_art;

SELECT * FROM artwork;

SELECT DISTINCT period 
FROM artwork;

SELECT title 
FROM artwork
WHERE artist_id = 3; 

SELECT title, artyear
FROM artwork
WHERE artyear > 1800 AND artyear < 1900;
-- OR
SELECT title, artyear
FROM artwork
WHERE artyear BETWEEN 1800 AND 1900;

SELECT title 
FROM artwork
WHERE period IN('Modern', 'Baroque');

SELECT title, period
FROM artwork
WHERE period LIKE '%impr%';
-- OR
SELECT title, period
FROM artwork
WHERE period REGEXP 'impr';

SELECT title, period
FROM artwork
WHERE period REGEXP 'ism$';

SELECT title 
FROM artwork
WHERE title REGEXP '^Old';

SELECT title
FROM artwork
WHERE title REGEXP 'the|in|on';

SELECT title, artdescription AS Description
FROM artwork
WHERE artdescription IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY Description; 
-- can't use Description for WHERE

USE bike;

SELECT * FROM product;

SELECT product_name, model_year, ROUND(list_price)
FROM product;
 
SELECT product_name, model_year, list_price + 10000
FROM product;

SELECT product_name, model_year
FROM product
WHERE (product_name LIKE 'Trek%' OR product_name LIKE 'Surly%') OR model_year <> 2016;  
-- change AND to OR
-- Without the ()s is only takes off 2016s for Surly

<li>Remind students of the quiz on the second day of class this week.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
