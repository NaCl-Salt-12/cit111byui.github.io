<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (W07 - Query Art DB)</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Because not all student created the art database properly, have them import the v_art database from the dump file so they all have the same database to query from.</li>
<li>They will also use a new bike shop database this week. Have the also import that database as well.</li>
<li>Demonstrate, explain, and have them follow along with examples of querying the v_art and bike databases. Here are some examples:</li>
<pre>
USE v_art;

SELECT * FROM artwork;

SELECT DISTINCT period 
FROM artwork;

SELECT title 
FROM artwork
WHERE artist_id = 3; 

SELECT title, artyear
FROM artwork
WHERE artyear > 1800 AND artyear < 1900;
-- OR
SELECT title, artyear
FROM artwork
WHERE artyear BETWEEN 1800 AND 1900;

SELECT title 
FROM artwork
WHERE period IN('Modern', 'Baroque');

SELECT title, period
FROM artwork
WHERE period LIKE '%impr%';
-- OR
SELECT title, period
FROM artwork
WHERE period REGEXP 'impr';

SELECT title, period
FROM artwork
WHERE period REGEXP 'ism$';

SELECT title 
FROM artwork
WHERE title REGEXP '^Old';

SELECT title
FROM artwork
WHERE title REGEXP 'the|in|on';

SELECT title, artdescription AS Description
FROM artwork
WHERE artdescription IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY Description; 
-- can't use Description for WHERE

USE bike;

SELECT * FROM product;

SELECT product_name, model_year, ROUND(list_price)
FROM product;
 
SELECT product_name, model_year, list_price + 10000
FROM product;

SELECT product_name, model_year
FROM product
WHERE (product_name LIKE 'Trek%' OR product_name LIKE 'Surly%') OR model_year <> 2016;  
-- change AND to OR
-- Without the ()s is only takes off 2016s for Surly
</pre>
<br>
<li>Remind students of the quiz on the second day of class this week.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>Mid-week
<ul>
<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(W07 - Bike Shop Queries):</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>This activity will be to retrieve the right data from the database for the bike shop owner (these are requests from the owner). Have the student complete these on their own or in groups. Here are some examples:</li>
<pre>
1. I need a list of all the customers with Gmail email accounts because there is a new Google application 
   that can interface with them through their email that we’d like to send them and invite them to use it.

2. Haro called and wants to discount all their bikes by 20%. Please get me the name of the bikes from Haro (brand_id 2) 
   and show the original price and then a column with the sales price with a readable column header.

3. We need to see the order number and order date from all orders at Santa Cruz Bikes (store_id 1) but I don’t need to see the 
   orders made by Mireya Copeland who’s staff_id is 2.  Just Fabiola, Genna and Virgie’s orders (everyone else who works there).

4. I need all the order numbers and order dates for the month of February 2017.

5. We need to clear out all our frame specific bikes and Women’s bikes. They are not selling well and we will be displaying 
   them in or annual sidewalk sale. Find all the bike product name with ‘Frame’ or ‘Frameset’ in the name or the word “Women’s” 

6. We need all the bikes product names that start with A-H and whose list price is more than 299.99 or exactly 299.99.  
   Sort them by product name. We will need to inventory those bikes first during inventory.
