<h2>During the Week</h2>

<li>First of the week:
<ul>
<li>The students should have completed the preparation materials before the beginning of the first class of the week.</li><br>
<li>Instead of a preparation check this week you can briefly demonstrate the additional topics by showing them a few subqueries, how to create an index and how to create a view. They won't use any of these in the project this week or next but you can consider letting them add one of the new topics to their project for extra credit if you'd like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>This week students will begin a project that will help the review everything they have learned in previous weeks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mid-week
<ul>
<li>There will be no quiz this week. This gives them more time to work on their project.&nbsp;</li>
