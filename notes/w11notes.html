<h2>Week 11 Outcomes</h2>

<h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will go over preparation materials before the first class of the week.</li>
<li>Consider reviewing the teaching tips and suggestions in the CIT111 - W11 Course Group discussion <a href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-returntype="Discussion">https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734</a>.</li>

<h2>During the Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>First of the week:
<ul>
<li>The students should have completed the preparation materials before the beginning of the first class of the week.</li><br>
<li>Instead of a preparation check this week you can briefly demonstrate the additional topics by showing them a few subqueries, how to create an index and how to create a view.</li>
  <li>Here are some examples you could use:</li>
  <pre>
  #1. Use a subquery that returns the faculty_id of those who teach for the college of Physical Science and Engineering.  
#Use the results of the subquery in a WHERE clause with an IN that uses the subquery results as the list of conditions to compare. 
#The main query will find the course(s) name(s) that are taught by those faculty.
USE univ;

SELECT DISTINCT c.name
FROM course c JOIN department d
	ON c.department_code = d.department_code
  JOIN faculty f
  ON d.department_code = f.department_code
WHERE faculty_id IN (SELECT faculty_id
		FROM faculty 
              	JOIN department
		ON faculty.department_code = department.department_code
		JOIN college
		ON department.college_id = college.college_id
		WHERE college.name = "Physical Science and Engineering");
                         
#2. Create an index on course name. 
#It will be referenced a lot so we'd like to create an index for faster retrieval from that column.

CREATE INDEX num_2 ON course(name);

#3. We always want a list of students we have enrolled in the CIT department. 
#Create a view called cit_enrollment that contains this information.

CREATE VIEW cit_enrollment AS
SELECT fname, lname
FROM student st JOIN enrollment en
    ON st.student_id = en.student_id
    JOIN section sec
    ON en.section_id = sec.section_id
    JOIN course cr
    ON cr.course_num = sec.course_num
    JOIN department dep
    ON cr.department_code = dep.department_code
WHERE dep.department_code = "CIT";

#4. Using the cit_enrollment view find out how many students 
#there are enrolled in the CIT department.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cit_enrollment;

<li>They won't use any of these "additional topics" in the project this week or next but you can consider letting them add one of the new topics to their project for extra credit if you'd like.</li>

<h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The homework will be instructor or TA graded and will be checking their ERD that they have the database designed properly, checking their SQL file with all their insert commands, and checking the dump file to make sure all the data was inserted correctly. </li>
<li>Here is the ERD:</li>
