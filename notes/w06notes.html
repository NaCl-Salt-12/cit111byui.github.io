<h2>During the Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>First of the week:
<ul>
<li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of the week and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (W06 - CRUD with Movies)</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Use the movie database they designed last week to practice with the C.U.D part of CRUD commands. Here are some examples:</li>
<pre>
CREATE DATABASE mdb;

USE mdb;

CREATE TABLE actors (actor_id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	last_name varchar(45) NOT NULL,
	first_name varchar(45) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (actor_id));


INSERT INTO actors VALUES
	(NULL,'Hanks', 'Tom'), (NULL,'Allen', 'Tim');
    
INSERT INTO actors VALUES
	(DEFAULT, 'Potts', 'Annie');


INSERT INTO actor_copy
	SELECT *
    FROM invoices
    WHERE last_name = 'Potts';
    
    
CREATE TABLE movies (movie_id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	title varchar(45) NOT NULL,
    rating varchar(10),
    r_year datetime NOT NULL,
    studio varchar(45),
PRIMARY KEY (movie_id));


INSERT INTO movies VALUES
	(DEFAULT, 'Toy Story', 'G', '1995-10-01', 'Pixar');
    
    
UPDATE actors 
SET first_name = 'Tommy'
WHERE last_name = 'Hanks';  -- won't work because we are in safe mode


UPDATE actors 
SET first_name = 'Tommy'
WHERE actor_id = 1;  -- works because we used a primary key to do it


DELETE FROM actors
WHERE actor_id = 1;

DROP TABLE movies;

DROP DATABASE mdb;
</pre>
<br>
<li>Remind students of the quiz on the second day of the week.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>Mid-week
<ul>
<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(W06 - Creating Insert Statements File):</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>As a class, use the movie data to create a file that contains all the insert statements they will need to populate the database. They will do something similar for their homework and this is good practice. You can populate a few tables as a class and then they can try some on their own or in groups.</li>
<br>
<li>Show them how to create a dump file with Server - Data Export - Self-contained file. They will need to know how to do this for one file of their homework.
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li><br>
<li>End of the Week<br />
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
<li>The homework due Saturday will be
<ul>
<li>creating a SQL file with all the insert commands to populate the art database. Once their database has data they will export a dump file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="gradingFeedback">
<h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The check and quiz are auto-graded. The homework will be instructor or TA graded. Look at their SQL insert commands file and their dump file. In the dump file you will check that they have the data in the tables properly. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="lookingAhead">
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remind students that they have readings and videos to watch and a check to complete before the first class of next week to be prepared for the next week.</li>
