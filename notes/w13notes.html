<li>There will be two days with two finals.

<h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The Coding Final is partially auto-graded so they get some of the points right away. Remind them that the rest of the points come when the instructor or TA grades each submitted query. The multiple choice final is auto-graded. </li>
<li>Here is the coding final queries key:</li>
<pre>
#1
#Write a query to show the country and population of all countries
#with population smaller than 5 million. 
#Sort the list by populations with the largest population first.
SELECT Name, Population
FROM country
WHERE Population < 5000000
ORDER BY Population DESC;

#2
#Write a query to show a list of the unique languages in the countrylanguage table. 
#Sort the list in alphabetical order.
SELECT DISTINCT Language
FROM countrylanguage
ORDER BY Language;

#3
#Write a query to list the continents and the number of countries in each continent.
SELECT Continent, COUNT(Name)
FROM Country
GROUP BY Continent;

#4
#Write a query that shows the columns (with specified labels):
#Country - name of country
#Avg_Population_of_Cities - the average population of the cities of that country 
#Sort the results by largest population average first
SELECT country.Name, AVG(city.Population) AS Avg_Population_of_Cities
FROM country JOIN city
ON country.Code = city.CountryCode
GROUP BY country.Name
ORDER BY Avg_Population_of_Cities DESC;
