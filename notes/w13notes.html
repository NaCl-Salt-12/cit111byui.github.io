<p>(W13 - Coding Review)</p>
<li>Here are some examples you could use to review for the coding final.</li>
<pre>
#Practice/Review 
#Write a query to show the country and surface area of all countries with a surface area 
#of more than 5 million. 
#Sort the list by surface area with the largest first.
SELECT Name, SurfaceArea
FROM Country
WHERE SurfaceArea > 5000000
ORDER BY SurfaceArea DESC;

#Write a query to show the country and life expectancy of all countries with a life expectancy 
#of more than 75 years old.
#Sort by life expectancy with larger age first
SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy
FROM country
WHERE LifeExpectancy > 75
ORDER BY LifeExpectancy;

#Write a query to show the unique forms of government in the country table. 
#Sort the list in alphabetical order. 
SELECT DISTINCT GovernmentForm
FROM country
ORDER BY GovernmentForm;

#Write a query to list the population in each continent. 
#Specify the Population Total with the label Population_Total.
#Sort by the largest population first. 
SELECT Continent, SUM(Population) AS Population_Total
FROM country
GROUP BY Continent
ORDER BY Population_Total DESC; 

#Write a query to list the continents and the number of governments in each continent 
#How many different forms of government are in each continent?
SELECT Continent, COUNT(DISTINCT GovernmentForm)
FROM country
GROUP BY Continent;

#Write a query that shows the offical language that is spoken in each country
SELECT Name, Language 
FROM countrylanguage JOIN country
ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode
WHERE IsOfficial = 'T';

#Write a query that shows 2 columns (with specified labels):
#Country - the name of the country
#Num_of_Languages - the number of languages spoken in that country
SELECT Name AS Country, COUNT(Language) AS Num_of_Languages
FROM country JOIN countrylanguage
ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode
GROUP BY Country;

#more practice
SELECT continent, AVG(city.population)
FROM country JOIN city
ON country.Code = city.CountryCode
GROUP BY continent;

SELECT * FROM countrylanguage
ORDER BY Percentage DESC;

SELECT max(percentage), continent
FROM countryLanguage RIGHT JOIN country
ON countryLanguage.CountryCode = country.code
GROUP BY country.continent;

SELECT country.name, COUNT(District)
FROM country JOIN city
ON country.Code = city.CountryCode
GROUP BY country.name;
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mid-week
<ul>
<li>There will be two days with two finals. You can have them take them both the last week of regular class or have them just take the coding final the last week of regular class and leave more time for reviews if you choose and then they would take the multiple choice final during testing week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>(W13 - Questions Review)</p>
<li>There is a Kahoot.com game with 50 questions to review for the final if you'd like to use it. The students really like this. You will need a kahoot user name if you want to use it. Set up an account at kahoot.com and email me andersonju@byui.edu your kahoot name if you'd like to use it and I'll share it with you. DO NOT share the kahoot with students just let them play it. Some of the questions are very similar to the final. In fact, I don't even let them take pictures of the screen while playing. Some questions are just freebies (any answer will give them points) so I can review topics. I do let them take pictures of those screen if they want. They begin at kahoot.it.</li>

<h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The Coding Final is partially auto-graded so they get some of the points right away. Remind them that the rest of the points come when the instructor or TA grades each submitted query. The multiple choice final is auto-graded. </li>
<li>Here is the coding final queries key:</li>
<pre>
#1
#Write a query to show the country and population of all countries
#with population smaller than 5 million. 
#Sort the list by populations with the largest population first.
SELECT Name, Population
FROM country
WHERE Population < 5000000
ORDER BY Population DESC;

#2
#Write a query to show a list of the unique languages in the countrylanguage table. 
#Sort the list in alphabetical order.
SELECT DISTINCT Language
FROM countrylanguage
ORDER BY Language;

#3
#Write a query to list the continents and the number of countries in each continent.
SELECT Continent, COUNT(Name)
FROM Country
GROUP BY Continent;

#4
#Write a query that shows the columns (with specified labels):
#Country - name of country
#Avg_Population_of_Cities - the average population of the cities of that country 
#Sort the results by largest population average first
SELECT country.Name, AVG(city.Population) AS Avg_Population_of_Cities
FROM country JOIN city
ON country.Code = city.CountryCode
GROUP BY country.Name
ORDER BY Avg_Population_of_Cities DESC;
