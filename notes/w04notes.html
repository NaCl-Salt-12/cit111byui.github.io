<h2>Week 04 Outcomes</h2>
<ul>

<li>Understand what a relational database is</li>
</ul>

<div class="beforeTheWeekBegins">
<h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will go over preparation materials and complete the preparation check before the first class of the week.</li>
<li>Consider reviewing the teaching tips and suggestions in the CIT111 - W04 Course Group discussion <a href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-returntype="Discussion">https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734</a>.</li>

<h2>During the Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>First of the week:
<ul>
<li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the beginning of the week and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (W04 - Relational Databases)</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Take the ERD you showed last week with their gathered data and now show them the tables. Explain again the tables and relationships involved. Explain that this is what makes a relational database relational. Talk about primary and foreign keys that were used. Show the design view of a table and also go over Not Null, Default values and Auto-increment and what they mean. Look at the data in each table and understand how primary keys won't repeat, but foreign keys might with a many relationship.</li>
<li>Remind students of the quiz the second class of the week.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mid-week
<ul>
<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(W04 - SQL Intro):</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Show them basic SQL queries with the data and then the more advanced queries that were time-consuming and difficult with spreadsheets and how much more efficient they are now with the database. Go over basic SQL commands as a bit of a preview but not teaching them yet. Here are some ideas:&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>
-- Top app genre
SELECT app_genre, COUNT(*)
FROM student
GROUP BY app_genre
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Top distraction category
SELECT dist_category, COUNT(*)
FROM student
GROUP BY dist_category
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Top worry category
SELECT worry_category, COUNT(*)
FROM student
GROUP BY worry_category
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Which group had the most selfies? (I had 2 classes so as I entered data I put a 1 or 2 at the end of location)
SELECT group_name, COUNT(type)
FROM student_group JOIN student
  ON student_group.group_id = student.group_id
  JOIN image
  ON student.student_id = image.student_id
WHERE student_group.location LIKE "%2" AND type="selfie"
GROUP BY group_name
ORDER BY COUNT(type) DESC;

-- Which major had the most documentation type images
SELECT major, COUNT(type)
FROM student
  JOIN image
  ON student.student_id = image.student_id
WHERE type="documentation"
GROUP BY major
ORDER BY COUNT(type) DESC;

The second screen shot should show their schema list (they should not have a store schema and the mysql schema should be hidden.</li>
