<p><b>Instructions</b>: Write the queries listed below using the
database you created in part 1 last week. Save your file as
UniversityQueries.sql. Use comments to number your queries. Use single
quotes for string values. Also, include the proper forward engineering
and inserts above the queries so the grader can have your database to
run your queries. If you need help remembering how to do some of these
queries, please watch the videos at the bottom of this page under
"Helpful Resources."</p>

<p>Query 1: Students, and their birthdays, of students born in
September. Format the date to look like it is shown in the result set.
Sort by the student's last name.</p>

<p>Query 2: Student's age in years and days as of Jan. 5, 2017. Sorted
from oldest to youngest. You can assume a 365 day year and ignore leap
day. (Hint: Use modulus for days left over after years. The 5th column
is just the 3rd and 4th column combined with labels.)</p>
