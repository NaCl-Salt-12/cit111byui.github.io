        <h1>What Can We Do With Data?</h1>
        <h2>Asking Good Questions</h2>
        <p>
            Just as we can ask good question to guide our lives, organizations must ask good questions in order to get the information they need to make good decisions to achieve success for their organization. Rather than just making decisions based on intuition or observations alone, organizations should use data that has been gathered to make decisions. This is referred to as data-driven decision making. By using data as the basis for decision-making, organizations can avoid bias and false assumptions that lead to poor decision-making.

        <h2>Let’s apply what we know about good questions to making data-driven decisions.</h2>
        <h2>Know Your Mission</h2>
        <p>
            President Henry B. Erying said that it is hard to see which questions matter unless you have some vision of your own life and of the world. The same is true of organizations. It is hard to see which questions matter to the organization unless there is some vision of the company’s goals, focus, or its mission.  Once you have a good understanding of these, you can determine what questions must be answered to achieve organizational goals. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The questions should be important and relevant to the organizational mission. A foundational knowledge of the industry and what problems your organization and others face in the industry, will also help determine these questions. A clear purpose and a defined problem to solve will also bring focus on what questions will be important. Remember we don’t want to focus on unimportant questions to the exclusion of good ones. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, a company may need to decrease expenses in order to remain profitable. A decision must be made. If the question of how to decrease the expenses in order to remain profitable is important and relevant to the company and their goals then getting as much data about how to solve this problem is the first step.
        </p>
        <h2>Identify Data Sources</h2>
        <p>
            Once we know what questions to ask, we need to find data sources that will answer the questions. Where does the data come from? What data does our organization create or gather that will contribute to this data store? If you know what questions need to be answered, you can work backwards and figure out what data would be needed to answer those questions. Also keep in mind any future questions or problems that might require that we store additional data for the future. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Data-driven decision making requires that the data is good, in other words it is high quality or credible data. Many times data can be inaccurate, outdated or unreliable. We must be good stewards of our data to make sure the decisions we make are based on good quality data. A company would not want to downsize staff or cut employee benefits if there is not good data to back this up. With good data, the company might see other ways to cut cost or, indeed, decide that downsizing is the right decision. As long as the questions are good and critical data has been gathered, good decisions can be made. But how do we use good data to help us make decisions?
        </p>
        <h2>Organize the Data</h2>
        <p>
            In this course we will learn how data will be stored and retrieved? As we learn about database design we will learn how to organize data into an efficient design so we can retrieve the information we need from it. We will be preparing the raw data and organizing it such a way that it becomes tables of useful information that we can ask questions of (or query) for answers to our questions. As we organize the data we can ensure data integrity and data consistency; making sure our data is accurate and reliable. We can also eliminate repeating the same values again and again by reducing data redundancy. As we querying the data, we will take tables of data and sort the data in a specific ways to make the reported data more useable. We will also filter data or hide unwanted data, displaying only the records we want to see. 
        </p>
        <h2>Analysis and Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            Once we retrieve the information we need to answer to our questions, we can analyze the information and draw conclusions from the information in order to answer our questions and make decisions that will help our organization succeed.

        <h2>Statement of Work (SOW)</h2>
        <p>
            As data systems or other projects are built to benefit organizations, a document called a Statement of Work can be used to plan a successful execution of the project. This works with data-driven decisions. Users of the data system need to make decisions based on the output from these systems or projects. This SOW document is the starting point of creating a data-driven system or project that will give us information to answer our organization’s questions. 
        </p>
        <h2>Let’s look at the 4 basic elements of the statement of work.</h2> 
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            What is the current system like and what are the problems and limitations with this system?
        </p>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
            This is a description of what needs to be done, a general statement of the requirements and expectations of the project.  This includes the scope of time, budget and resources available for the project.
        </p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            This is the purpose of the project and what it is intended to achieve. In this course we will be focusing on data-driven systems like databases and from these databases how decisions-making information is retrieved.
        </p>
        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>
            Each task involved in creating the project is broken up into discrete task. Each task will have an estimated time frame of completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later in the course, as we begin looking at database design, we will revisit statement of work documents that were created as we begin the design process. The statement of work is the beginning point to see what will be going into the design and is completed before a database system is created.
