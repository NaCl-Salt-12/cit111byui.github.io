<p><b>Purpose</b>: In addition to using functions properly, the purpose
of this assignment is for you to practice problem solving; analyzing
what a question asks and breaking the problem into steps that lead to a
solution.</p>

<p><b>Instructions</b>: Using the magazine and bike schemas, write SQL
queries in Workbench that will solve all the answers to the following
scenarios. Write all the queries in one tab in Workbench. Above each of
your queries, write a comment similar to this:</p>

<code>-- Query 1</code>

<p>Save your SQL script with all five queris as a .sql file and submit
your saved .sql file.</p>

<h3>Magazine Schema</h3>
<p>1. List each magazine name and magazine price with 3% off the price

<p>3. Show the subscriptionStartDate and subscriptionLength and add the
subscriptionLength to the subscriptionStartDate to see the end date of
each subscription. The numbers in the subscriptionLength column are
given in months. Format the end date as Month name, day number with

<h3>Bike Schema</h3>
<p>4. We need a list of all the product names without the year at the
end of the product_name string. Notice that some product_names have two
years listed. Make sure you take those off as well. Order your results
by product_id and limit your results to the first 14.</p>

<p>5. List the product name and then take the 2024 model year bikes and
divide the price into 3 equal payments. Display one of the payments with
a dollar sign, comma at the thousands place, and two decimal places.</p>
