    <p><strong>CIT 111 &ndash; Fall 2019</strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Course Syllabus</em></strong></p>
    <p>&ldquo;We have thousands of times more available information than Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln. Yet which of us would think ourselves a thousand times more educated or more serviceable to our fellowmen than they? The sublime quality of what these two men gave to us&mdash;including the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address&mdash;was not attributable to their great resources of information, for their libraries were comparatively small by our standards. Theirs was the wise and inspired use of a limited amount of information. Available information wisely used is far more valuable than multiplied information allowed to lie fallow.&rdquo;&nbsp;Dallin H. Oaks</p>

    <p><strong><em>Expectations and Requirements</em></strong></p>
    <p>This course requires you to complete videos and readings located on the Canvas course before the first class of each week. You are also required to install a database management system (DBMS) on your computer and use that DBMS to design and implement small databases. You must have a laptop computer to use in class. &nbsp;You should also have a notebook for taking notes during lecture.</p>
    <p>Go to<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.byui.edu/computer-information-technology/software/hardware-for-cit-courses">http://www.byui.edu/computer-information-technology/software/hardware-for-cit-courses&nbsp;&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</a><br />to see the department's hardware and software requirements.&nbsp;For the best hands-on learning experience, each student should have access to a reliable laptop computer that they bring to each class session, with:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>sufficient user or administrator privileges to install new software on that computer,</li>
    <li>an i5 or better processor capable of hyper-threading,</li>
    <li>sufficient RAM to comfortably operate virtual machines on the laptop (8GB or more recommended, 4GB minimum (if you have extreme patience and pain tolerance)</li>
    <li>sufficient battery power to use the computer throughout each class session for in-class activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Students unable to meet this technology requirement should contact me during the first week of the semester.</p>
    <p>VMware (we might be installing this together in class, but you need a computer capable of running it) If we use VMware, Window Pro is required, not Windows Home (There is a student version you can get with free license)</p>
    <p><strong><em>Course Materials</em></strong></p>
    <p>No textbook is required for this course, all readings and videos are found on Canvas.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Course Standards</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
    <p>Attending each class period is expected. &nbsp;<strong>Missing class seven times will result in a maximum grade of C+ for the semester. &nbsp;Missing class ten times will result in an F for the semester.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you are in class or not,&nbsp;<strong>you</strong>&nbsp;are responsible for all lectures, in-class exercises, tests, programs, and handouts. You may obtain class notes, assignments, instructions, etc. from another student.</p>
    <p><strong>Schedule</strong></p>
    <p>You can view the class schedule in the calendar section of I-Learn. The instructor may make changes, deletions, corrections, or additions to the schedule during the semester.</p>
    <p><strong>Grading</strong></p>
    <p>Your grade will be computed according to the following table.</p>
    <p><strong>Percent of Final Grade</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Videos/Readings &nbsp; &nbsp; 10%</li>
    <li>Quizzes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20%</li>
    <li>Assignments&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;40%</li>
    <li>Project&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10%</li>
    <li>Exams&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20%</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Checks</strong></p>
    <p>At the beginning of each week, there will be required videos and readings that go with that week's discussions. The videos and readings have a check that goes along with them that can be completed as you complete the viewings and readings. The checks are due before the first class of each week.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Quizzes</strong></p>
    <p>All quizzes are closed book. Each quiz has a 12-minute time limit and will be taken<strong>&nbsp;in class on the&nbsp;scheduled&nbsp;date</strong>. &nbsp;Quizzes can only be taken late if you contact me before the quiz date with a valid reason (e.g., field trip for another class) or you contact me as soon as possible in the case of an emergency.&nbsp; The quiz will be given twice in class that same day. The first time it is taken will be by yourself and the second time you can take it as a group with a discussion about the questions.</p>
    <p><strong>Homework</strong></p>
    <p>All graded homework submissions&nbsp;<strong>must be your own work</strong> but you may collaborate with students, tutors, teaching assistants and the instructor to help you understand the concepts. Don&rsquo;t just give your work to another student. These homework assignments are due on Saturday evenings 11:59pm.</p>
    <p><strong>Late Work</strong></p>
    <p>There is a 20% penalty applied to any late work received within 7 days of the due date. &nbsp;There is a 40% penalty applied to any late work received within 14 days of the due date. Work turned in later than 14 days after the due date will receive no credit.</p>
    <p><strong>Exams</strong></p>
    <p>Exam questions will be drawn from the videos, readings, lectures, in-class coding and group work, and assignments. &nbsp;The Exams will be 60-minute exams given in the classroom. There are two Final Exams and both will be comprehensive and taken in the last two week of the course. <strong>You may not take the exams early.</strong></p>
